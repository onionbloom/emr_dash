PWA,2022-09-11,CGK,IP240,DELAY,1:30,46,1,34-43,"Problem :
 During aircraft preparation for IP240, PWA found IR1 FAULT.
 PWA as IP240 experience RTA due to during Engine start NAV TCAS FAULT appear on ECAM.
 PWA as IP102 experience RTA during taxi NAV TCAS FAULT appear on ECAM.
 
  
 Action :
 Ref AMM 34-13-00-740-002 reset CB and realignment result problem still exist. To avoid delay, problem transfer to HIL ref MEL 34-10-04B
 To minimize delay, IP240 change aircraft with PK-PWD and PK-PWA operate as IP102.
 Do read out PFR fault message 34-12-34: Check related CB with TCAS system result no pop out. Performed TSM 34-43-00-810-801-A. Ref PFR shown TCAS fault failure message
 ADIRU (1FP1) source from IR1. Do swap ADIRU 1 and ADIRU 3 Ref AMM 34-43-00-740-001 Result OK. For make sure, do realignment and do bite test of IR 1, 2, 3 result all test OK
 and TCAS fault message disappear. Continue performed Idle check both engine result ECAM status normal and no other message appears ref AMM 71-00-00-710-715-A.
 Aircraft declared AOG and IP102/103 cancelled. Continue troubleshoot ref TSM 34-43-00-810-801-A wiring check performed as follows:
 - Check 115 VAC at pin AC/1 result good.
 - Check ground signal at pin AC/7 result good.
 - Performed TCAS ground scanning and bite test. Result test OK.
 But ref TFU 34.43.00.021 state that TCAS PN 940-0351-005 experienced ECAM Warning NAV TCAS FAULT temporary displayed in flight.
 
  
 Preventive Action :
 Make sure every HIL issued are comply with Operational and Maintenance Procedure as stated on the MEL.
 Ref Technical Request from Airbus recommends to follow recommendation of the TFU 34.43.00.021 to use PN 940-0351-006.
  
 Follow Up :
 Sourcing and provide spare TCAS Computer with PN 940-0351-006 and ADIRU HG2030AE23.

 APU Bleed Fault
 IR alignment blinking on ECAM
 
 Action :
 Reset APU ECB, Restart APU. APU running normal and bleed normal ref AMM 36-12-00-810-801.
 Realignment of ADIRS ref AMM 34-10-00-860-004-A. Alignment succeed.
 
  
 Pre Analysis :
 Since ECB has been reset, the APU will experience shut down and all electrical power are off.  
 Upon the availability of electrical power, ADIRS alignment need to be done.
 IR align memo flashing in green appears on ECAM.
 Crew not realized to enter the present position on MCDU.
 
  
 Preventive Action :
 In the event of Transit check, if theres a defect which is deferrable, Engineer in charge should insert the defect to HIL/ASDCS to avoid delay.
 Notify Flight Operation to review ADIRS alignment procedure.
 
  
 Follow Up :
 Issue Discrepancy Report from PAS Quality to GMF (Quality dept & DPSMM) regarding Engineers lack of awareness on transit handling.

 IDG Eng #1 Oil High Temp +- 152 C degree
  
 Action :
 05.50 PFR Check ATA 79-40-00 IDG FRV (Oil Temp) Eng 1A
 06.00 Check IDG Oil Actual found overfill (on red band).
 06.05 Contact MCC GMF and perform draining IDG Eng#1 Oil ref AMM 12-13-24-680-040. Advise by MOC Pelita to perform servicing ref AMM 12-13-24-612-041-B.
 06.35 Aircraft serviceable
 
  
 Pre-Analysis:
 History / Maintenance Action Taken:
 On 22 Sept 2022 PIREP IDG Oil temp more than 147 C degree (momentarily). IDG Oil Level found overfill. Action: Perform servicing IDG oil until green band IAW AMM 12-13-
 24-612-804-A. Problem no longer appear until 21 Oct 2022.
 On 21 Oct 2022 Routine Task Card IDG #1 Filter replacement is performed (Task card A00000416)
 On 22 Oct 2022 Elect ECAM IDG #1 Temp Intermittent rise during descent +148 C degree. Ref TSM 79-40-00-810-801-A PFR check for IDG failure warning per message relative
 to fuel level sensing element: FUEL LEVEL SENSING L INN TEMP SENSOR 29QJ1. Ref TSM: 28-46-00-810-813-A: do BITE Test of FLSS result Shown L INN TEMP SENSOR 29QJ1.
 Check actual IDG oil on yellow band, do servicing IDG OIL until green band. Ref AMM: 12-13-24-612-804-A. Problem no longer appear until 12 Nov 2022.
 12 Nov 2022 during Daily check found IDG DP pop out. Replaced filter but packing NIL spare. Issued TR to replace O-ring max in 10 days.
 13 Nov 2022 PIREP AML Seq A002227 IDG #1 TEMP TENDENCY RAISING DURING DESCENT UP TO LIMIT 147 CENTIGRADE. Action: IDG #1 found almost to red band. Servicing
 carried out up to correct level ref AMM 12-13-24-612-041-B. Problem no longer appear until 19 Nov 2022.
 19 Nov 2022 replace IDG Eng #1 O-ring
 20 Nov 2022 PIREP During Descent Adv IDG Oil Temp +- 152 C degree. Servicing performed IAW REF AMM 12-13-24-680-040.
 
 Conclusion:
 Engine #1 IDG high oil temperature appear after every IDG oil servicing.
 There is no AML record for engine idle run prior to check IDG oil level.
 Maintenance was performed by ineffective AMM reference
 Lack of understanding maintenance procedure refer to AMM 12-13-24-612-041-B
 Suspected engine idle run or engine dry motoring was not performed prior to check IDG oil level Ref AMM 12-13-24-612-041-B PARA 4F.
 Missed coordination when the aircraft has a defect on transit at DPS
 
  
 Preventive Action :
 Conduct briefing to encourage to GMFAA personnel related to AMM 12-13-24-612-041-B IDG oil servicing by GMF
 Quality Department
 MOC will control and monitor for maintenance task related to IDG oil servicing
 Remind GMFAA Line Maintenance personnel to establish a good communication and coordination only with PAS MOC
 instead of GMFAA MCC in the event of operational irregularities
 Remind GMFAA personnel to record engine ground run on AML
 Perform Daily Checklist correctly
 
  
 Follow Up :
 PAS Quality will create Discrepancy Report to GMFAA
 Perform one time inspection of IDG oil level on all PAS fleet and report to MOC PAS
